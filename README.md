# Project Title
    Industrial Copper Modelling
## Technologies need to know
 - Python
 - Numpy
 - Pandas
 - streamlit
 - Scikit-learn
## Project Approach
Exploring skewness and outliers in the dataset.
Transforming the data into a suitable format and performing any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.
Developing a machine learning regression model which predicts the continuous variable 'Selling_Price' using the decision tree regressor.
Developing a machine learning classification model which predicts the Status: WON or LOST using the decision tree classifier.
Creating a Streamlit page where you can insert each column value and get the Selling_Price predicted value or Status (Won/Lost).
